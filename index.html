    <h1>Tachyon</h1>
    <p>A **tachyon** is a hypothetical particle in theoretical physics that is believed to travel faster than the speed of light. Derived from the Greek word *tachy* meaning "swift," tachyons are characterized by having imaginary mass and are not compatible with the framework of special relativity if they were real. Their existence would imply the possibility of violating causality, such as sending information back in time. Although often used in science fiction to explain faster-than-light travel or communication, tachyons have never been observed in any experiment and remain purely speculative within modern physics.
